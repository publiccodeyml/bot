**Voting is now open on this proposal!**

If you are a member of the [Steering Committee](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/blob/main/governance/charter.md#steering-committee-publiccodeymlsteering-committee) you can now vote!

The polls will stay open for {{ vote_period_days }} days, until **{{ vote_end_date }}**.
At the end of that period the Chair (@{{ chair_team }}) will mark the voting period as over using `@{{ bot_username }} vote-end`

Leave a :+1: (thumbs up) **on this comment** to accept the proposal or a :-1: (thumbs down) to reject it.
