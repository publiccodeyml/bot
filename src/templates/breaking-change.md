Thanks for your contribution :pray:

This is now marked as a [`breaking-change` proposal to the standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/labels/standard-breaking-change) proposal to the Standard, this means that an old version of `publiccode.yml` won't be compatible with the new version.

Breaking changes can be released with a new major version at most once every two years, provided the current version of the Standard has been deprecating the object of this proposal for at least 6 months.

Example of breaking changes are removal of keys or changes to key types.

The Chair will eventually pick up this proposal and start the voting procedure using `@{{ bot_username }} vote-start`.
