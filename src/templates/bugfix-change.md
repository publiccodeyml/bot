Thanks for your contribution :pray:

This is now marked as a [`bugfix-change` proposal to the standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/labels/standard-bugfix-change),
this means that this change won't break any compatibility with the old versions of the Standard.

Example of bugfix changes are typo fixes.

The Chair will eventually pick up this proposal and start the voting procedure using `@{{ bot_username }} vote-start`.
