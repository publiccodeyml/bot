Thanks for your contribution :pray:

This is now marked as a [`deprecation-change` proposal to the standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/labels/standard-deprecation), this means that this change won't break any compatibility with the old versions of the Standard,
and it will be possibile to make the definitive change 6 months after the deprecation with a new major release.

The next eligible voting round will take place on **{{ next_vote_date }}**
