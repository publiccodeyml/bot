Thanks for your contribution :pray:

This is now marked as a [`minor-change` proposal to the standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/labels/standard-minor-change),
this means that old versions of `publiccode.yml` will still be valid with this change.

Example of minor changes are additions of new keys or making keys optional.

The Chair will eventually pick up this proposal and start the voting procedure using `@{{ bot_username }} vote-start`
