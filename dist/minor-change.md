Thanks for your contribution :pray:

This is now marked as a [`minor-change` proposal to the standard](https://github.com/publiccodeyml/publiccode.yml/labels/standard-minor-change),
this means that old versions of `publiccode.yml` will still be valid with this change.

Example of minor changes are additions of new keys or making keys optional.

The next eligible voting round will take place on **{{ next_vote_date }}**
